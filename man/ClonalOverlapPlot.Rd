\arguments{
\item{data}{The product of \link[scRepertoire:combineTCR]{scRepertoire::combineTCR}, \link[scRepertoire:combineTCR]{scRepertoire::combineTCR}, or
\link[scRepertoire:combineExpression]{scRepertoire::combineExpression}.}

\item{clone_call}{How to call the clone - VDJC gene (gene), CDR3 nucleotide (nt),
CDR3 amino acid (aa), VDJC gene + CDR3 nucleotide (strict) or a custom variable
in the data}

\item{chain}{indicate if both or a specific chain should be used - e.g. "both",
"TRA", "TRG", "IGH", "IGL"}

\item{group_by}{The column name in the meta data to group the cells. Default: "Sample"}

\item{group_by_sep}{The separator used to concatenate the group_by when multiple columns are used.}

\item{full}{Whether to plot the full heatmap, or just a triangle. Default is TRUE.}

\item{split_by}{The column name in the meta data to split the plots. Default: NULL}

\item{order}{The order of the groups. Default is an empty list.
It should be a list of values. The names are the column names, and the values are the order.}

\item{method}{The method to calculate the overlap. Default is "raw".
\itemize{
\item "overlap" - overlap coefficient
\item "morisita" - Morisitaâ€™s overlap index
\item "jaccard" - Jaccard index
\item "cosine" - cosine similarity
\item "raw" - exact number of overlapping clones
See also \link[scRepertoire:clonalOverlap]{scRepertoire::clonalOverlap}.
}}

\item{palette}{The color palette to use. Default is "Blues".}

\item{label_accuracy}{The accuracy of the labels. Default is NULL.
If NULL, it will be 1 for "raw" and 0.01 for other methods.}

\item{label_cutoff}{The cutoff for the labels to show. Default is 1e-3.}

\item{cluster_rows}{Whether to cluster the rows. Default is FALSE.}

\item{cluster_columns}{Whether to cluster the columns. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_row_names}{Whether to show the row names. Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_column_names}{Whether to show the column names. Default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to the specific plot function \code{\link[plotthis:Heatmap]{plotthis::Heatmap()}}.}
}
\value{
A ComplexHeatmap object or a list if \code{combine} is FALSE
}
\description{
Plot the overlap of the clones in different samples/groups.
